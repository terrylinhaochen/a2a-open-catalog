# A2A Design Principles

The A2A protocol is built on several core design principles that ensure it meets the needs of modern AI agent systems while remaining flexible and extensible.

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Embrace Agentic Capabilities

A2A focuses on enabling agents to collaborate in their natural, unstructured modalities, even when they don't share memory, tools and context. This principle recognizes that agents have unique capabilities and should be able to interact naturally without requiring complete alignment of their internal systems.

**Key Aspects:**
- Support for unstructured communication
- Flexible message formats
- Context-aware interactions
- Natural agent-to-agent dialogue

### 2. Build on Existing Standards

The protocol is built on top of existing, popular standards including HTTP, SSE, JSON-RPC, which means it's easier to integrate with existing IT stacks. This approach reduces adoption barriers and leverages proven technologies.

**Standards Used:**
- **HTTP/HTTPS** - For reliable, secure communication
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** - For real-time updates and streaming
- **JSON-RPC** - For structured request-response patterns
- **RESTful principles** - For resource-oriented interactions

### 3. Secure by Default

A2A is designed to support enterprise-grade authentication and authorization, with parity to OpenAPI's authentication schemes at launch. Security is built into the protocol from the ground up.

**Security Features:**
- **Authentication** - Multiple auth schemes (OAuth2, API keys, JWT)
- **Authorization** - Fine-grained access control
- **Encryption** - End-to-end encryption support
- **Audit trails** - Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### 4. Support for Long-Running Tasks

Designed to support scenarios from quick tasks to deep research that may take hours or days, with real-time feedback and state updates. This is crucial for complex AI workflows.

**Long-Running Features:**
- **Task persistence** - Survive system restarts
- **Progress updates** - Real-time status reporting
- **State management** - Maintain context across sessions
- **Resume capability** - Continue interrupted tasks

### 5. Modality Agnostic

The agentic world isn't limited to just text, which is why we've designed A2A to support various modalities, including audio and video streaming. This future-proofs the protocol for emerging AI capabilities.

**Supported Modalities:**
- **Text** - Traditional text-based communication
- **Audio** - Voice and audio streaming
- **Video** - Visual communication and streaming
- **Multimodal** - Combined text, audio, and video
- **Structured data** - JSON, XML, and other formats

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Principles

### Interoperability First

Every design decision prioritizes interoperability between different agent platforms and frameworks. This ensures that agents built with different technologies can communicate effectively.

### Extensibility

The protocol is designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements without breaking existing implementations. This is achieved through versioning and backward compatibility.

### Performance

A2A is optimized for performance, supporting high-throughput scenarios and low-latency communication between agents. This is essential for real-time applications.

### Reliability

The protocol includes built-in reliability features such as retry mechanisms, error handling, and fault tolerance to ensure robust agent communication.

## üîÑ Evolution Principles

### Backward Compatibility

New versions of the protocol maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations, ensuring smooth upgrades and adoption.

### Community-Driven

The protocol evolves based on community feedback and real-world usage patterns, ensuring it meets actual needs.

### Open Development

The protocol development process is transparent and open, with regular updates and community involvement.
