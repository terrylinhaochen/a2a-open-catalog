## 🔧 Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Task Delegation
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client Agent] --> B[Data Analysis Agent]
    B --> C[Visualization Agent]
    C --> D[Report Generation Agent]
    D --> A
```

**Use Case:** Multi-step data processing workflow where each agent specializes in a specific task.

### Pattern 2: Parallel Processing
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client Agent] --> B[Agent 1]
    A --> C[Agent 2]
    A --> D[Agent 3]
    B --> E[Results Aggregator]
    C --> E
    D --> E
```

**Use Case:** Processing multiple independent tasks simultaneously for improved performance.

### Pattern 3: Conditional Routing
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client Agent] --> B{Task Type?}
    B -->|Simple| C[Basic Agent]
    B -->|Complex| D[Advanced Agent]
    B -->|Critical| E[Expert Agent]
```

**Use Case:** Routing tasks to different agents based on complexity or requirements.

## 🚀 Best Practices

### Agent Design
1. **Single Responsibility** - Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose
2. **Stateless Design** - Avoid maintaining state between requests when possible
3. **Error Handling** - Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Documentation** - Provide comprehensive documentation for all capabilities

### Integration
1. **Standard Interfaces** - Use consistent API patterns across all agents
2. **Versioning** - Implement proper versioning for agent capabilities
3. **Testing** - Thoroughly test agent interactions and edge cases
4. **Monitoring** - Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Security
1. **Authentication** - Use secure authentication mechanisms
2. **Authorization** - Implement fine-grained access control
3. **Data Protection** - Ensure sensitive data is properly protected
4. **Audit Logging** - Maintain detailed audit trails

## 📝 Creating Your Own Agent

### Step 1: Define Capabilities
```json
{
  "agent_name": "My Custom Agent",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": {
    "primary_function": "Description of main capability",
    "supported_inputs": ["text", "json", "file"],
    "supported_outputs": ["text", "json", "file"],
    "authentication": ["api_key", "oauth2"]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Implement A2A Interface
```python
from a2a import Agent, Task, Response

class MyCustomAgent(Agent):
    async def process_task(self, task: Task) -> Response:
        # Implement your agent logic here
        result = await self.process_input(task.input)
        return Response(content=result, status="completed")
```

### Step 3: Test and Validate
- Test with A2A compliance tools
- Validate against the official A2A specification
- Perform integration testing with other agents

### Step 4: Submit to Catalog
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Provide usage examples
- Submit through the A2A Catalog platform
