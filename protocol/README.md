## ðŸŽ¯ What is A2A?

The **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol** is an open standard designed to enable seamless communication and collaboration between AI agents. In a world where agents are built using diverse frameworks and by different vendors, A2A provides a common language, breaking down silos and fostering interoperability.

A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents. Drawing on Google's internal expertise in scaling agentic systems, the A2A protocol addresses the challenges identified in deploying large-scale, multi-agent systems for enterprise customers.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Benefits

- **Cross-Platform Connectivity** - Connect agents built on different platforms (LangGraph, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, custom solutions)
- **Task Delegation** - Enable agents to delegate sub-tasks, exchange information, and coordinate actions
- **Secure Interaction** - Agents interact without sharing internal memory, tools, or proprietary logic
- **Ecosystem Growth** - Foster a more interconnected, powerful, and innovative AI ecosystem
- **Cost Reduction** - Lower long-term costs while increasing autonomy and productivity gains
- **Standardized Management** - Standardized method for managing agents across diverse platforms and cloud environments
